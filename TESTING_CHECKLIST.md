- [ ] Verify successful registration and automatic login

### Registration Error Handling
- [ ] Try registering with existing email - should show error
- [ ] Test network connectivity issues
- [ ] Verify error messages are user-friendly

## 3. Authentication Testing

### Login Flow

## 5. Authentication State Management

### Session Persistence

- [ ] Test app restart after device reboot

### Logout Functionality
- [ ] Logout from profile page
- [ ] Verify redirect to login page
- [ ] Confirm all premium features are restricted after logout
- [ ] Try accessing authenticated-only features

## 6. Navigation Testing

### Route Handling

## 8. Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Network Connectivity
- [ ] Test login with poor network connection
- [ ] Test app behavior when network is lost during use
- [ ] Verify appropriate error messages for network issues

### Authentication Edge Cases
- [ ] Test rapid login/logout cycles
- [ ] Test multiple authentication attempts
- [ ] Verify proper cleanup on authentication errors

### Memory and Performance
- [ ] Test app performance with authentication state changes
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during extended use
- [ ] Check for memory leaks in authentication flows

## 9. Security Testing

### Data Protection
- [ ] Verify passwords are not stored locally
- [ ] Check that sensitive user data is properly secured
- [ ] Test authentication token handling

### Firebase Security

- [ ] Check iOS-specific security features

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
