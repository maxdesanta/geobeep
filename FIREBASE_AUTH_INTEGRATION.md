## Authentication Patterns Used

### 1. Consumer Pattern for Authentication State
```dart

  builder: (context, authService, child) {
    if (authService.isAuthenticated) {
      // Authenticated user UI
    } else {
      // Guest mode UI with restrictions
    }
  },
)
```

### 2. Premium Feature Protection
```dart
if (authService.isAuthenticated) {
  // Execute premium feature
} else {
  // Show login prompt dialog
  showDialog(/* Premium feature dialog */);
}
```

### 3. Authentication-Aware Navigation
- AuthWrapper automatically routes users based on authentication status
- Guest users can access most features but see restrictions for premium ones
- Authenticated users have full access to all features
